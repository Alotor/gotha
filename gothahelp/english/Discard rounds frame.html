            Discard rounds frame
        </h1>
        Useful to keep certain rounds in a tournament and discard others.
        <br>
        May be used before exporting part of a tournament. Typically, if you run a main tournament in an european congress, you will have to split your rounds, round 1-5 for 1st week, round 6-10 for 2nd week (as in example below)
        
        <p align="center">

        </p>
        <p>
            The "Discard rounds" button will :
        <ul>
            <li>Discard unchecked rounds</li>
            <li>(if checkbox selected) Remove players implied in no round</li>
            <li>(if checkbox selected) Shift rounds to fill discarded rounds
                <br>&nbsp;In the example above, results of 2nd week (rounds 6-10) will be shifted to rounds 1-5</li>
        </ul>
